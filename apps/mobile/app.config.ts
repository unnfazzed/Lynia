 * no key). When it's unset the rest of the app still builds; only the Android map renders blank.

 * Android FCM credentials file (`google-services.json`) from the Firebase project. Android needs this
 * baked into the build for `expo-notifications` to mint a native FCM device token — without it,
 * `getDevicePushTokenAsync()` returns nothing and live push never delivers, even with the server on
 * `PUSH_PROVIDER=fcm`. It's founder-supplied: register an Android app for `zw.co.lynia` in the Firebase
 * console, download the file, and provide it either as an EAS **file** secret (`GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON`
 * → a materialised path at build time) or by dropping it at `apps/mobile/google-services.json` for a
 * local dev build. The file is gitignored (project identifiers — kept out of the repo).
 *
 * Attached only when present, so an unprovisioned build still succeeds — push just stays inert (the
 * whole client path is best-effort). iOS FCM would use `ios.googleServicesFile` + APNs, added later.
